# Social Network Analysis

## Project Objectives:

The purpose of PART I and Part II of this project is to look at some disciplinary data from a middle school. The file "discipline-data.csv" shows which teacher sent which student to the principal during the semester. The "igraph" package is used to visualize the disciplinary relationships between teachers and students as a network. You can read more about igraph here:

The purpose of Part III of the project is to visualize the social network of a graduate course in Data Mining based on the classes the students are taking. Then, the centrality measures such as degree and betweeness are analyzed. Afterwards, K-Modes cluster analysis is perfomed based on the classes the students are taking.
